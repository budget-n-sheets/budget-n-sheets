<p>The Google Sheets add-on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lazy-notes-extras/jdpmjoidlekmfbhiaiejabjgmkogbbnl" target="_blank"><i>Budget n Sheets</i></a> was recently updated and it needs you
to re-authorize it to run on your behalf.</p>

<p>The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you
re-authorize the add-on. You can accomplish this by opening the spreadsheet <a href="<?= spreadsheetUrl ?>" target="_blank"><?= spreadsheetName ?></a> and running the add-on through the menu. Alternatively, you can
click this link to approve authorization directly:</p>

<p><a href="<?= authorizationUrl ?>" target="_blank">Click here</a> to re-authorize the add-on.</p>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you only once until the
add-on is re-authorized.</p>
