  <p>The developers of the add-on Budget n Sheets, as well as the add-on Budget n Sheets itself, have no knowledge of, way to retrieve, or way to reset your password. <strong>Don’t forget your password!</strong> Budget n Sheets won’t be able to reset it or recover your backup data if you do.</p>

  <p>An email will be sent to you with the backup file attached to it. You can <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/30719" target="_blank">save the attachment to your Google Drive</a>.</p>
